## Description

Folder-by-Feature is a file organization methodology used in software development to structure code and assets based on the features or functionalities of the application. Instead of organizing files by their type (e.g., images, styles, scripts) or layers (e.g., data, presentation, business logic), Folder-by-Feature groups files that are related to a specific feature or module of the application together in their own directory.

The key principle of Folder-by-Feature is to keep all the files related to a particular feature in a single location, making it easier to understand and maintain that feature's codebase. Each feature is treated as an independent unit, and it contains all the necessary files, including components, styles, scripts, templates, and assets, to implement that feature.

```css
assets/
  |- home/
      |- images/
          |- home-banner.jpg
          |- home-icon.png
      |- fonts/
          |- home-font.ttf
      |- videos/
          |- home-video.mp4
  |- about/
      |- images/
          |- about-banner.jpg
          |- about-icon.png
      |- fonts/
          |- about-font.ttf
      |- videos/
          |- about-video.mp4
```


## Advantages

Modularity: Each feature is self-contained in its own folder, making it easier to understand and work with specific parts of the application.

Separation of Concerns: Related files are kept together, promoting better separation of concerns and reducing the chance of conflicts or unintended dependencies between features.

Scalability: As the application grows, it becomes easier to add, remove, or modify features without affecting other parts of the codebase.

Collaboration: Folder-by-Feature encourages team members to work on different features independently, which can improve collaboration and productivity.

Code Reusability: Encapsulating features in their own folders can lead to better code reusability across different parts of the application.
